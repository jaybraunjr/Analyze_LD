# Analyze_LD
Files created by Jay Braun and Siyoung Kim, adapted mainly from MDAnalysis. These scripts can support any lipid, but were used for CHYO and TG within lipid droplets.

count.py and count_chyo.py: analyze and quantify SURF-molecules

interdigit.py and interdigit_chyo.py: analyze and quantify interdigitation

apl.py calculated area per lipid, slice_csv.py shortens csv file

# Tasks

- [ ] Import files from other repos. Download or clone?
- [ ] Include the new scripts. This would be the relative density, and denisty of the interdigitation-modified scripts
- [ ] Make Jupyter notebook flows
